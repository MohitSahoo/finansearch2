\begin{abstract}

Efficient access to large collections of unstructured documents is essential for research and decision-making. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine information retrieval with large language models to answer queries using external documents.However, most RAG systems rely only on semantic retrieval, which misses exact keywords and technical terms, while keyword-only methods lack semantic understanding.This paper aims to build a robust RAG system that combines semantic and keyword-based retrieval for better document question answering.
We propose FinanSearch, a hybrid RAG system that integrates BM25 keyword search with embedding-based semantic search using weighted fusion. It uses document chunking, FAISS-based vector retrieval, and BM25 lexical scoring.Results show that the hybrid method improves retrieval accuracy over semantic-only baselines and retrieves more relevant passages, especially for domain-specific queries.The main contribution is a simple and effective hybrid RAG framework for real-world document search and question answering.

\section{Introduction}

The rapid growth of unstructured digital documents across domains such as finance, enterprise systems, research, and governance has created a strong demand for intelligent information access systems. Traditional information retrieval methods based on lexical matching, such as BM25, are effective for exact keyword queries but fail to capture deeper semantic meaning \cite{robertson2009bm25}. With the rise of deep learning, dense retrieval methods using neural embeddings have significantly improved semantic matching in tasks such as open-domain question answering \cite{karpukhin2020dpr,reimers2019sbert}. More recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that combines retrieval with large language models to produce grounded and fact-based answers \cite{lewis2020rag,guu2020realm}. However, research has shown that dense retrieval alone often misses exact terms, technical phrases, and structured information, while sparse retrieval lacks semantic understanding \cite{lin2021hybrid,luan2021sparse}. Hybrid retrieval, which integrates both sparse and dense methods, has therefore gained attention as a promising direction for building reliable and practical RAG systems \cite{zhu2021hybrid}. FinanSearch is developed within this context, aiming to provide a balanced and scalable hybrid retrieval framework for real-world document question answering.
Despite significant progress in information retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, current solutions still face critical limitations. Dense retrieval models, such as those based on neural embeddings, excel at capturing semantic similarity but often fail to retrieve documents containing exact keywords, numerical values, or domain-specific terminology \cite{karpukhin2020dpr,reimers2019sbert}. This becomes especially problematic in technical domains such as finance, law, and enterprise documentation, where precise wording and structured terms are essential. On the other hand, traditional lexical methods like BM25 are highly effective for exact matching but lack the ability to understand semantic relationships between concepts \cite{robertson2009bm25}.
Most existing RAG systems rely predominantly on dense retrieval, leading to incomplete retrieval and reduced answer quality when key lexical cues are missed \cite{lewis2020rag}. Although recent research has explored hybrid retrieval approaches, many proposed methods remain complex, poorly integrated, or insufficiently evaluated in real-world, domain-specific environments \cite{lin2021hybrid,zhu2021hybrid}. There is still a lack of practical, configurable, and easy-to-deploy hybrid retrieval systems that balance lexical precision and semantic understanding. This research gap motivates the development of FinanSearch, which aims to provide a simple yet effective hybrid retrieval framework tailored for real-world document search and question answering.
In domains such as finance, enterprise analytics, and regulatory compliance, access to accurate and timely information is critical for decision-making. Financial documents often contain structured data, technical terminology, and precise numerical values, where even minor retrieval errors can lead to incorrect analysis or financial risk. Existing search and question-answering systems frequently fail to retrieve such critical details due to over-reliance on either semantic similarity or exact keyword matching alone.
FinanSearch is motivated by the need for a retrieval system that can handle both semantic understanding and lexical precision in financial and technical documents. By combining dense semantic retrieval with lexical keyword-based search, FinanSearch ensures that both conceptual relevance and exact terms are preserved. This significantly improves trust, reliability, and usability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in real-world financial and enterprise applications, making it a valuable tool for analysts, researchers, and decision-makers.

The main objectives of FinanSearch are:

\begin{itemize}
\item To design a hybrid retrieval system that combines semantic embedding-based search with lexical keyword-based search.
\item To improve retrieval accuracy for domain-specific documents, especially those containing technical terms and numerical information.
\item To integrate the hybrid retrieval system into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for reliable question answering.
\item To evaluate the performance of the proposed system against semantic-only retrieval baselines.
\item To develop a practical and user-friendly system suitable for real-world financial and enterprise document search.
\end{itemize}
This work presents FinanSearch, a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation system designed for accurate and reliable document search and question answering. The system follows a multi-stage pipeline that includes document ingestion, chunking, embedding generation, and indexing using both dense and sparse retrieval methods. Dense semantic retrieval is performed using vector embeddings stored in FAISS, while lexical retrieval is handled using BM25 scoring.
For each user query, FinanSearch retrieves relevant document chunks from both retrieval methods and combines their scores using a weighted fusion strategy. The top-ranked results are then provided to a large language model, which generates grounded and context-aware answers. This approach ensures that both semantic relevance and exact keyword matching are preserved.
The main contributions of this work are:  
(1) a practical hybrid retrieval framework that balances semantic understanding and lexical precision;  
(2) an end-to-end full-stack RAG system that integrates hybrid retrieval with large language models; and  
(3) a configurable and deployable architecture suitable for real-world financial and enterprise document search.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the literature review. Section III describes the overall methodology of the proposed system. Section IV details the hybrid retrieval methodology. Section V reports the experimental analysis, results, and discussion. Section VI discusses the practical applications of FinanSearch. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper and outlines directions for future work.




\section{Literature Review}
Early information retrieval (IR) systems were built on lexical matching, where documents are ranked based on term overlap with the query. Probabilistic IR models and term-weighting schemes remain highly influential due to their efficiency, interpretability, and strong performance on exact-match queries. Among them, BM25 is widely adopted as a strong baseline because it balances term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document-length normalization \cite{robertson2009bm25}. Beyond BM25, feature-based ranking models combine multiple signals (e.g., term statistics, proximity, field-specific weights) using linear scoring functions to improve retrieval quality \cite{metzler2007linear}. Language-model approaches to retrieval further formalize ranking as the likelihood of generating the query from a document model, where smoothing plays a crucial role in robust estimation \cite{zhai2004smoothing}. Although sparse retrieval remains effective for exact terminology, it typically struggles when relevant documents use synonyms, paraphrases, or conceptually related expressions that do not share surface-level terms with the query.
With the development of deep learning and transformer architectures, representation learning has enabled retrieval systems to capture semantic similarity beyond lexical overlap. Transformers introduced self-attention mechanisms that significantly improved contextual language understanding \cite{vaswani2017attention}, and pretrained models such as BERT demonstrated strong transfer learning capabilities for downstream NLP tasks \cite{devlin2019bert}. Dense retrieval methods leverage neural encoders to map queries and passages into a shared embedding space, enabling nearest-neighbor search for relevant documents \cite{karpukhin2020dpr}. Sentence-BERT further improves the quality of sentence and passage embeddings by learning representations optimized for similarity tasks \cite{reimers2019sbert}. Dense retrieval has shown major gains on open-domain question answering and semantic search, especially when lexical mismatch is common. However, dense retrievers can miss exact keywords, rare entities, numbers, and domain-specific phrases, particularly in specialized corpora where precise terminology carries critical meaning.
To address limitations of bi-encoder dense retrieval, many systems use multi-stage ranking pipelines: a fast retriever generates candidates, followed by a more expensive re-ranker that jointly encodes query and passage for deeper relevance modeling. BERT-based re-ranking demonstrated substantial improvements in ranking quality by capturing fine-grained interactions between query and passage text \cite{nogueira2019bert}. In parallel, late-interaction architectures such as ColBERT aim to preserve token-level matching signals while maintaining efficient retrieval, improving effectiveness without fully sacrificing speed \cite{khattab2020colbert}. These approaches underscore a key trend in modern IR: balancing efficiency and effectiveness via staged retrieval and ranking.
Dense retrieval at scale requires efficient similarity search over large embedding collections. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) methods enable fast search in high-dimensional spaces while maintaining strong recall, making them essential for practical dense retrieval deployments \cite{xiong2018ann}. FAISS is a widely used library for large-scale vector similarity search, supporting GPU acceleration and a range of indexing strategies that trade off speed, memory, and accuracy \cite{johnson2017faiss}. These systems form the backbone of many modern semantic search and RAG implementations by enabling low-latency retrieval over large corpora.
Hybrid retrieval integrates sparse lexical matching (e.g., BM25) with dense semantic similarity to capture the strengths of both paradigms. Prior work argues that dense and sparse methods often retrieve complementary sets of documents: sparse retrieval excels on exact matches and rare terms, while dense retrieval improves semantic recall \cite{lin2021hybrid,luan2021sparse}. Hybrid strategies can be implemented through score fusion, query-dependent weighting, or candidate union followed by re-ranking. Recent studies emphasize that hybrid retrieval is especially valuable in technical or domain-specific settings where exact terminology, identifiers, and numeric values are critical, yet semantic understanding is still required to capture conceptual relevance \cite{zhu2021hybrid}. Despite strong motivation, many hybrid approaches are either difficult to tune, tightly coupled to specific benchmarks, or not packaged into deployable end-to-end systems, leaving room for practical frameworks with configurable fusion strategies.
Large language models have enabled natural language interfaces to knowledge, but they can produce hallucinated or outdated information when relying only on internal parameters. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving relevant passages and conditioning generation on those sources, improving factual grounding for knowledge-intensive tasks \cite{lewis2020rag}. Related work such as REALM explores retrieval-aware pretraining, showing that retrieval integrated into language modeling can improve downstream QA performance \cite{guu2020realm}. Generative open-domain QA systems that explicitly leverage retrieved passages further demonstrate that retrieval quality is a primary driver of answer quality \cite{izacard2021qa}. More recent directions focus on making retrieval more adaptive and reliable: Self-RAG introduces mechanisms to retrieve, generate, and critique outputs to reduce ungrounded responses \cite{li2023selfrag}, while active retrieval frameworks explore when and how retrieval should be invoked for improved response quality \cite{asai2023active}. These works reinforce that robust retrieval is fundamental for trustworthy generation, especially in domains where precision is required.
Evaluating retrieval systems requires datasets that reflect diverse domains and realistic query distributions. BEIR provides a heterogeneous benchmark suite for evaluating retrieval methods under domain shift and zero-shot settings, highlighting gaps between controlled benchmark performance and real-world generalization \cite{thakur2021beir}. Additional research explores improving dense retrieval without extensive relevance labels, addressing practical constraints in specialized domains \cite{gao2022dense}. Beyond academic benchmarks, deployable systems must also consider latency, scalability, index update workflows, and the interpretability of retrieval results---factors that become especially important for enterprise and finance-oriented applications where traceability and precision are essential.

Overall, the literature shows strong progress in sparse retrieval, dense retrieval, and RAG-based question answering, yet each family of methods has limitations when used in isolation \cite{robertson2009bm25,karpukhin2020dpr,lewis2020rag}. Hybrid retrieval is a promising solution that leverages complementary strengths of lexical precision and semantic understanding \cite{lin2021hybrid,zhu2021hybrid}. FinanSearch is positioned within this research direction, focusing on a practical, configurable hybrid retrieval pipeline that integrates BM25 and dense vector search (FAISS) to improve reliability and usefulness for domain-specific document question answering.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{System Architecture}

The backend is implemented in Python using FastAPI, providing RESTful endpoints for query processing, configuration management, and document upload.

\textbf{Document Processing Pipeline:} Uploaded documents (PDF, TXT, Markdown) are processed through a text chunking pipeline. We employ character-based splitting with configurable chunk size (default: 500 characters) and overlap (default: 100 characters) to preserve context across boundaries.

\textbf{BM25 Retriever:} Implements the Okapi BM25 ranking function with default parameters $k_1=1.5$ and $b=0.75$. Documents are tokenized, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) statistics are computed.

\textbf{FAISS Retriever:} Utilizes OpenAI's \texttt{text-embedding-3-small} model (1536 dimensions) to generate dense vector representations. FAISS provides efficient approximate nearest neighbor search with IndexFlatL2.

\textbf{Ensemble Retriever:} Combines results from BM25 and FAISS retrievers using weighted linear combination. Given retrieval scores $s_{bm25}$ and $s_{faiss}$, the ensemble score is:
\begin{equation}
s_{ensemble} = \alpha \cdot s_{bm25} + (1-\alpha) \cdot s_{faiss}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the fusion weight (default: 0.5).

\textbf{Generation Module:} Retrieved context is formatted into a prompt template and sent to OpenAI GPT-4 for answer generation. The system implements streaming responses for improved user experience.

The React-based frontend provides three key interfaces:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Chat Interface:} Real-time question-answering with message history
    \item \textbf{Configuration Panel:} Adjustment of retrieval parameters (search mode, chunk size, retrieval count, temperature)
    \item \textbf{Document Management:} File upload and vector store rebuilding
\end{enumerate}

A unique feature is the \textit{Retrieved Context Display}, which visualizes the document chunks used for each answer, including source filenames and relevance scores. This transparency enhances user trust and enables debugging.

\subsection{Hybrid Retrieval Methodology}

FinanSearch adopts a hybrid retrieval strategy to address the limitations of relying solely on either lexical or semantic search. In financial and technical documents, critical information may appear as exact terminology (e.g., regulatory clauses, accounting terms) or as paraphrased semantic content (e.g., risk descriptions, strategic explanations). A single retrieval paradigm is therefore insufficient to ensure both precision and recall.

To overcome this, the system dynamically supports three retrieval modes: keyword-based retrieval, semantic retrieval, and hybrid retrieval. The hybrid mode is the default configuration and is designed to maximize retrieval robustness across heterogeneous document collections.

\textbf{Lexical Retrieval (BM25):}
The BM25 retriever captures exact term matches between the user query and documents. This is particularly effective for entity names, financial metrics, section headers, and regulatory terminology where lexical overlap is critical. Given a query $Q$ and document $D$, the BM25 score is computed as:
\begin{equation}
\text{BM25}(Q,D) = \sum_{t \in Q} \text{IDF}(t) \cdot \frac{f(t,D) \cdot (k_1+1)}{f(t,D) + k_1 \cdot (1-b+b \cdot \frac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}})}
\end{equation}
where $f(t,D)$ denotes the frequency of term $t$ in document $D$, $|D|$ is the document length, and $\text{avgdl}$ is the average document length across the corpus. The inverse document frequency is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\text{IDF}(t) = \log\frac{N-n(t)+0.5}{n(t)+0.5}
\end{equation}
with $N$ representing the total number of documents and $n(t)$ the number of documents containing term $t$.

\textbf{Semantic Retrieval (Dense Embeddings):}
To capture semantic similarity beyond surface-level token overlap, FinanSearch employs dense vector retrieval using OpenAI embeddings. Both user queries and document chunks are encoded into a shared vector space, enabling retrieval of semantically relevant passages even when exact keywords are absent. Similarity between a query embedding $\mathbf{q}$ and document embedding $\mathbf{d}_i$ is computed using cosine similarity:
\begin{equation}
\text{sim}(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{d}_i) = \frac{\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{d}_i}{|\mathbf{q}| |\mathbf{d}_i|}
\end{equation}
This approach is particularly effective for capturing conceptual relationships, explanatory text, and paraphrased financial insights.

\textbf{Score Normalization and Fusion:}
Because BM25 and dense retrievers operate on different scoring scales, raw scores are first normalized to a common range using min–max normalization:
\begin{equation}
\hat{s}i = \frac{s_i - \min(s)}{\max(s) - \min(s)}
\end{equation}
The normalized scores are then combined using a weighted linear fusion strategy:
\begin{equation}
s{ensemble} = \alpha \cdot \hat{s}{bm25} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \hat{s}{faiss}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ controls the contribution of lexical versus semantic retrieval. In this work, $\alpha$ is set to 0.5, providing equal emphasis to both retrieval signals. This balanced fusion improves recall while preserving precision for keyword-sensitive queries.

\textbf{Ranking and Context Selection:}
Following score fusion, documents are ranked by their ensemble scores, and the top-$k$ passages are selected for downstream processing. These passages are formatted into a structured prompt that preserves source boundaries and contextual continuity. This ensures that the generation module receives coherent, relevant, and diverse evidence for answer synthesis.

Overall, the hybrid retrieval methodology enables FinanSearch to robustly handle varied query types ranging from precise factual lookups to high-level analytical questions. By integrating lexical exactness with semantic generalization, the system significantly improves retrieval quality, which directly translates into more accurate, grounded, and trustworthy generated responses..

\section{Experimental Analysis, Results and Discussion}

Experiments are conducted using the Earnings Call Transcripts Dataset, which consists of quarterly earnings call transcripts from publicly listed companies across multiple industries. Each transcript contains prepared remarks by company executives, summaries of financial performance, analyst questions, and management responses. This dataset is particularly suitable for evaluating retrieval-augmented question answering systems because it contains long unstructured text, dense financial terminology, numerical values, and domain-specific expressions. All transcripts are cleaned to remove formatting artifacts and speaker labels, after which the text is segmented into overlapping chunks of 300 words with a 50-word overlap to preserve contextual continuity. These chunks form the basic retrieval units for all evaluated models.

Two retrieval-augmented generation systems are evaluated. The first is a semantic-only RAG baseline that relies exclusively on dense vector retrieval. In this model, each text chunk is converted into vector embeddings using a sentence-transformer model and indexed with FAISS to enable efficient similarity search. For a given query, the top-$k$ chunks are retrieved using cosine similarity and supplied to a large language model for answer generation. This approach is effective for capturing high-level semantic similarity but is less reliable when queries require exact matching of financial terminology, numerical values, or company-specific identifiers.

The second system is FinanSearch, the proposed hybrid RAG framework. FinanSearch indexes the same text chunks in parallel using BM25 for lexical retrieval and FAISS for dense semantic retrieval. For each query, candidate chunks are retrieved from both indexes, and their scores are normalized and combined using weighted linear fusion. The highest-ranked chunks are then passed to the language model for answer generation. This hybrid design allows FinanSearch to retain the semantic generalization of dense retrieval while ensuring sensitivity to exact keywords, financial figures, and named entities that are common in earnings call analysis.

Retrieval performance is quantitatively compared using Precision@5, Recall@5, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Precision@5 measures the proportion of relevant chunks among the top five retrieved results, Recall@5 measures the proportion of all relevant chunks retrieved within the top five, and MRR captures how early the first relevant chunk appears in the ranked list. Table~\ref{tab:retrieval} summarizes the retrieval performance of both models.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Retrieval Performance Comparison}
\label{tab:retrieval}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Precision@5} & \textbf{Recall@5} & \textbf{MRR} \\
\hline
Semantic-Only RAG & 0.61 & 0.55 & 0.58 \\
\hline
\textbf{FinanSearch (Hybrid)} & \textbf{0.78} & \textbf{0.72} & \textbf{0.75} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:retrieval}, FinanSearch consistently outperforms the semantic-only baseline across all retrieval metrics. Precision@5 improves from 0.61 to 0.78, indicating that a larger fraction of the retrieved chunks are relevant. Recall@5 increases from 0.55 to 0.72, demonstrating that the hybrid approach captures more relevant information within the top results. The improvement in MRR from 0.58 to 0.75 shows that relevant chunks appear earlier in the ranked list, which is particularly important for downstream answer generation where only a limited number of chunks can be used as context.

In addition to retrieval quality, the factual correctness of generated answers is evaluated. Answer accuracy is defined as the percentage of generated responses that are factually correct when compared against the source transcripts. Table~\ref{tab:accuracy} reports the answer generation accuracy for both systems.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Answer Generation Accuracy}
\label{tab:accuracy}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Answer Accuracy (\%)} \\
\hline
Semantic-Only RAG & 67\% \\
\hline
\textbf{FinanSearch (Hybrid)} & \textbf{83\%} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results in Table~\ref{tab:accuracy} show a substantial improvement in answer quality when hybrid retrieval is employed. FinanSearch improves answer accuracy from 67\% to 83\%, confirming that retrieval quality has a direct and significant impact on generation performance. By ensuring that both exact financial details and semantically relevant context are retrieved, the hybrid approach provides the language model with more complete and reliable evidence for answer synthesis.

Overall, these findings demonstrate that hybrid retrieval is particularly well suited for financial documents such as earnings call transcripts, where precision and semantic understanding are equally critical. Queries involving financial metrics, company-specific references, or analyst questions benefit from lexical matching, while broader interpretive questions rely on semantic retrieval. By integrating both paradigms, FinanSearch offers a more accurate, robust, and practical solution for real-world financial document question answering.
\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

This paper presented FinanSearch, a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation system designed for accurate document retrieval and question answering in domain-specific environments. By integrating BM25-based lexical retrieval with dense semantic retrieval, FinanSearch effectively balances exact keyword matching and semantic understanding. Experimental results on the Earnings Call Transcripts Dataset demonstrate that the proposed system consistently outperforms a semantic-only RAG baseline across both retrieval effectiveness and answer accuracy metrics. These findings confirm that hybrid retrieval is particularly well suited for financial and technical documents, where precise terminology, numerical details, and contextual interpretation are equally important.

Future work will focus on enhancing retrieval adaptability and system robustness. One promising direction is the development of adaptive fusion strategies that dynamically adjust the contribution of lexical and semantic retrieval based on query characteristics. Incorporating re-ranking mechanisms using cross-encoder models may further improve precision by refining the ordering of retrieved passages. Additional evaluation on other domain-specific corpora, such as legal and medical documents, will help assess the generalizability of the proposed approach. Further extensions include supporting real-time index updates, enabling multilingual retrieval, and integrating user feedback mechanisms to continuously improve retrieval quality. Together, these enhancements will move FinanSearch toward a more flexible, scalable, and user-centric retrieval-augmented generation framework.
